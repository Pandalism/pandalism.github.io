<p>
A selection of diverse projects I have been involved with or have worked on over the years. This will slowly grow as I add older ones and also finally add all the Data Sciencey ones I have been doing, much more to come!

<div class='gallery'>
{% for project in site.projects %}

  <div class='gallery-box'>
      <div class='gallery-item'>
        <a href="{{ project.url | absolute_url}}">
        <img class='gallery-img' src="{{project.image | absolute_url}}" />
        <div class='gallery-shadow'><div class='gallery-text'><h4>{{ project.title }}</h4></div></div>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
