Hello. I'm **Felix Diaz-Maroto Rivas**, you might also find me under the pseudonym [**Pandalism**] here and there. .

With too much curiosity and not enough time, I'm just making my way though life embarking on little projects, although I never really documented any of them very well. So I thought, what better way of doing it than finally finishing my website and start blogging in earnest?

Regardless of why you stumbled across this island in the digital sea, welcome to my blog/project site.
