## Travels
Admittedy I have been blessed/privileged to go on many a trip over the years, here's all the places these tired feet have stepped on:

#### Top trips:
- **Japan** - Its vastly different, but its also very well developed.
- **USA** - American culture permeates the whole western world, was nice to see some first hand.
- **Vancouver Island** WWOOF volunteering - Beautiful place, loved working on the little gardens, met lovely people. Dream retirement location.

## CO2 and Water
This is my current measurements for my yearly CO2 ~~and Water~~ impact:

| Year        	| 2016   	| 2017   	| 2018   	| 2019   	|
|-------------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|
| **Total [kg]**| **3157**| **1675**| **4508**| **1973.7**|
| Flights     	| 3156.8 	| 1674.5 	| 1406.4 	| 459.2  	|
| Car         	|        	|        	| 1326.6 	| 699.2  	|
| Motorbike   	|        	|        	| 752.8  	| 3.8    	|
| Electricity 	|        	|        	| 837.0  	| 356.8  	|
| Natural Gas 	|        	|        	| 185.0  	| 454.7  	|
| Other       	|        	|        	|        	|        	|

Note:
  - 2016 & 2017 only considers Flights
  - 2018 only has half a years worth of data on Electrical Energy and gas

Now, large companies will always shift the blame on consumers, [but we all know that is bullshit](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/more-recycling-wont-solve-plastic-pollution/), and that really the strongest environmental protection comes from reasonable, scientifically backed regulations. [However our individual behaviours do have a non-trivial effect, and it is something I personally want to work on](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17967738/climate-change-consumer-choices-green-renewable-energy).

Environmental sustainability is a god-damn **tricky** subject in of itself, without considering the issues with measuring and data collection, so how do we figure what are the most unsustainable aspects of our life? Sometimes it feels like we are shooting in the dark ("Buy coconut oil, its good for the environment", [Is it though](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/is-your-obsession-with-coconuts-harming-the-environment/)?).

Here's when my unhealthy obsession with tracking everything and making a spreadsheet for the most trivial things comes in handy. Utility meters tell us much of our gas, electricity and water usage, so I just used that. Then I keep track of running costs for all my vehicles including fuel usage, so I have litres put into the car (which translates directly to CO2 emitted). Also, due to Nationalisation reasons I've been keeping track of all my flights; so using some online calculators, you can figure out CO2 emitted.  


##### Assumptions
There are a lot of assumptions here:
 - Does not include missed or cancelled flights.
 - Flights calculated with [ICAO one](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx).
 - No impact factors for height of CO2 emission.
 - Diesel:	2.68kg/L, Petrol:	2.31	kg/L, Gas:	2.27	kg/m3, Electricity:	0.53	kg/kwh.
 - Does not include taxis, trains or other forms of transport.
 - Does not include driving and energy usage once at the holiday destination.
 - Assumes for the car and motorcycle I was by myself.


## Further Ideas

##### Landfill and recycling waste stream impact.
Look, I'm not going to go count every piece of trash, nor can I realistically change my lifestyle to have zero landfill waste. However it would be interesting to know the household output of landfill vs recycling, and how it changes over the year and what can be improved. Maybe some sort of rPi weighing scale for bins? are smart bins a thing?

##### Food type and source impacts.
There are times I can't believe the 100 mile diet and other locally sourced foods actually benefit the environment at all, but you have to admit, getting bananas and avocados shipped across the Atlantic in **huge bunker oil burning ship** can't be good either. This would be more of a short term experiment I'd guess, as this is an absolute pain to do LCA (LifeCycle Analysis) on food and the supermarket infrastructure. Would also reflect the benefits of a low-meat diet (However I can **never** give up bananas and avocados).

##### Track buy-vs-reuse-vs-upcycle.
I already am rather prone to fixing my devices, buying second hand, and attempt to freecyle everything, but it would be nice to some how measure this, or keep track? However no clue how to do so at the moment.
