## Travels
Admittedy I have been blessed/privileged to go on many a trip over the years, here's all the places these tired feet have stepped on:

#### Top trips:
- **Japan** - Its vastly different, but its also very well developed.
- **USA** - American culture permeates the whole western world, was nice to see some first hand.
- **Vancouver Island** WWOOF volunteering - Beautiful place, loved working on the little gardens, met lovely people. Dream retirement location.

## CO2 and Water
This is my current measurements for my yearly CO2 ~~and Water~~ impact:

| Year        	| 2016   	| 2017   	| 2018   	| 2019   	| 2020   	|
|-------------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|
| **Total [kg]**| **2919**| **2313**| **3885**| **6370**| **1806**|
| Flights     	| 2919 	  |  1675	  | 1157 	  | 2544  	|374  	  |
| Car         	|        	|  639 	  | 1647	  | 2066  	|782  	  |

###### Notes:
  - 2016 & 2017 only considers Flights
  - 2018 only has half a years worth of data on Electrical Energy and gas
  - [More information on this in this blog post,](/2019/04/22/co2-tracking/) and [the next blog post on the topic.](/2019/10/16/co2-update/)

#### Assumptions
There are a lot of assumptions here:
 - Does not include missed or cancelled flights.
 - Flights calculated with [ICAO carbon offset calculator](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx).
 - No impact factors for height of CO2 emission.
 - Diesel:	2.68kg/L, Petrol:	2.31	kg/L, Gas:	2.27	kg/m3, Electricity:	0.53	kg/kwh. Now includes Well-to-tank factors and is taken from the values calculated by the [UK Goverment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2019).
 - Does not include taxis, trains or other forms of transport.
 - Does not include driving and energy usage once at the holiday destination.
 - Assumes for the car and motorcycle I was by myself.
