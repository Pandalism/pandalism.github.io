Wanting to get much more into Data Science for my career I decided to take the **Cambridge Spark Applied Data Science** bootcamp.

It was great fun, and I learnt a lot which I hope to be applying soon at work!

## Curriculim

The course was taught part time over weekends, with assignments on the *edu-Kate* platform in between. Admittedly it wasn't easy to handled a full time job at the same time but I have no regrets at doing it part-time particularly with the on going pandemic.

Modules included:

- ADS01 Building foundations: Tools, Mathematics and Best Practices for Data Scientists
- ADS02 Data Exploration, Supervised Learning and Feature Engineering
- ADS03 Classification, Model Selection and Regularisation
- ADS04 Regression, Time Series and Unsupervised Learning
- ADS05 Databases and NoSQL
- ADS06 Processing Big Data
- ADS07 Ensemble Methods
- ADS08 Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- ADS09 Natural Language Processing
- ADS10 Recommender Systems

And all finished with a capstone project on EDA and submission for the M5 Kaggle Competition (will post about it soon too)

## Technologies/Skills used
 - Python, Pandas, Sklearn, statsmodels
 - Conda and Git
 - Causalens Data Analysis Platform
