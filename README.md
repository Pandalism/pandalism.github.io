Welcome to my blog! Not much to say, I am currently using it to just post about projects and what not, mostly related to the blog itself, some machine learning aspects, data science, electronics, or 3D printing.

## Roadmap
To remind myself what I'd like to achieve here:
 - [x] v0.1 - Start the site!
 - [x] v0.5 - Site has a landing page following the structure outlined before, but uses the theme from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
 - [x] v1.0 - Same content/structure/features but now using my own layouts/themes/design :bowtie:
 - [x] v1.1 - expand icon set to sub categories
 - [x] v1.2 - make banner pictures appear on the mini icons next to blog entries
 - [x] v1.4 - Add tagging/categories
 - [x] v1.5 - Paginate
 - [x] v1.6 - Comments + Slideshows
 - [x] v1.7 - Add projects and project layout (delayed)
 - [ ] ???? - Fix tables in mobile
 - [ ] ???? - Embed Binder notebooks
 - [ ] ???? - Move projects to use CSS grid
 - [ ] v2.0 - Update design pending criticisims

## Credits
I seriously would have gone nowhere if I had gone back to trying to do everything in just HTML, CSS and JS. I knew I wanted a static site but until I found out about static site generators it looked like a gargantuan effort to make a blog:no_mouth:.
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - Thanks to its creators, contributors and maintainers.
- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) - Thanks especially to [Barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark) for his most wonderful and accessible introduction to Jekyll blogging.
