So I decided to try and finally get through to making a website as both a showcase/resume type thing as well as blogging. Not really sure how far I want to go with this but I thought I might as well use it to keep track of the little projects I sometimes do.

## Structure and Features
I figure it'll be a pretty standard webpage structure:

 * About
 * Blog
 * Projects
    * Subproject page 1
    * Subproject page 2
 * Contact/Social-media stuff? <- this will go in footer


## Roadmap
To remind myself what I'd like to achieve here:
 - [x] v0.1 - Start the site!
 - [x] v0.5 - Site has a landing page following the structure outlined before, but uses the theme from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
 - [x] v1.0 - Same content/structure/features but now using my own layouts/themes/design :bowtie:
 - [ ] v1.1 - expand icon set to sub categories
 - [ ] v1.2 - make banner pictures appear on the mini icons next to blog entries
 - [ ] v1.3 - Add projects and project layout
 - [ ] v1.4 - Add tagging/categories
 - [ ] v2.0 - Update design pending criticisims

## Credits
I seriously would have gone nowhere if I had gone back to trying to do everything in just HTML, CSS and JS. I knew I wanted a static site but until I found out about static site generators it looked like a gargantuan effort to make a blog:no_mouth:.
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - Thanks to its creators, contributors and maintainers.
- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) - Thanks especially to [Barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark) for his most wonderful and accessible introduction to Jekyll blogging.
