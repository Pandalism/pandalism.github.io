Include to embed single local images. It will try to display a _thumb
version of the image until it is clicked on which will open the full sized image
in a new window.

If it does not find an appropiate _thumb version of the image it will use onerror
JavaScript fallback to select the main image anyways.

Hopefully this reduces loading times of somewindows significantly since the
images are the primary reason for slow loading times.

example use:
{% include pic.html assetsFolder=exampleAssetsFolder link=pictureName caption=anExampleCaption %}

insert in code to replace usual markdown aspects.

{% assign filetype = include.link | split: "." | last %}
<a href="/{{include.assetsFolder}}/{{include.link}}" target="_blank">{% if filetype == "gif" %}
<img src="/{{include.assetsFolder}}/{{include.link}}"
alt="{{include.caption}}">{% else %}
<img src="/{{include.assetsFolder}}/{{include.link | replace: '.', '_thumb.'}}"
alt="{{include.caption}}"
onerror="if (this.src != '/{{include.assetsFolder}}/{{include.link}}') this.src = '/{{include.assetsFolder}}/{{include.link}}'">
{% endif %}<em>{{include.caption}}</em></a>
