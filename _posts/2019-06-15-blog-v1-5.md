As I mentioned in the [Website v1.0 post](), it was in its minimum viable state. There was still a lot which I wanted to include, and slowly in my spare moments I've managed to enable a couple of new features:
- category and subcategory icons!
- tags and tag clouds
- new picture and gallery includes instead of markdown images
- css tweaking


## Tags

A fundamental part of any blog, tags, are here! Now here possible without plugins (as github-pages doesnt allow them), thanks to [Long Qian's tutorial](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).

I basically followed what it said, just changing bits and bobs to fit my website. Coincidentally he used the Hyde theme which is what inspired me to spin up my own look theme, so they look remarkably similar!

## Pictures and Galleries
I noticed that some of the pages where taking a long time to load, mostly due to the super large images I was using. Problem was, markdown's usual way of handling images was a bit painful to use with thumbnails and popup images. So I now use a jekyll 'include' to insert the html into the post itself, passing the link and caption as parameters.

It will try to display a \_thumb version of the image until it is clicked on which will open the full sized image in a new window.

If it does not find an appropiate \_thumb version of the image it will use `onerror` JavaScript fallback to select the main image anyways.

## Future plans

There's still a lot of features I have partially implemented which need finishing off: `categories`, `subcategory icons`, `major project pages`, `gallery layout`, `tags`, etc...

Then there is also all the CSS fine tuning in margins, sizes, colours, and responsiveness tests...

**In addition to porting many years worth of projects into posts**

But its a start!
