I thought it would be neat to try and finally make a blog which I can use to showcase some of the hobby stuff I get up to. Not so much so anyone reads it but because it might just force me to keep going.

I thought for simplicity, in both hosting and in content creation, might be best to leverage jekyll's intimate integration into github, content managment and versioning? all in one? accessible from anywhere in the world? Sounds pretty good to me, and probably better than anything else I could churn out for now!
