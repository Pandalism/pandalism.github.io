I thought it would be neat to try and finally make a blog which I can use to showcase some of the minor hobby projects I get up to. Mostly because it might just force me to keep going on projects and document what I do with a little more care.

I thought for simplicity, in both hosting and in content creation, might be best to leverage Jekyll's intimate integration into GitHub: content management and versioning? all in one? accessible from anywhere in the world? Sounds pretty good to me, and probably better than anything else I could churn out for now...

I'll be using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to start the site, but then adapting it and overhauling the design as I go along. The site is hosted [here](https://github.com/Pandalism/pandalism.github.io), and you are free to look at it, reuse it (if anything at all is useful) and even complain about how terribly written it is. Go for it!
