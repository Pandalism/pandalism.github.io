Was fooling around with one of my other projects, and needed to make a gear to fit a wormdrive, it worked, but well, I realised I didnt really know how to make gears. So I took the plunge and started researching how to make gears parametrically for the future!

## Download

You can download the Solidworks CAD part below, all you need to do to use it is change the 4 top parameters in the equations folder to modify it for your needs!

## Prints!

Sent off a couple of the gears to the printer to test them out, and I'm quite pleased (not at the quality of the prints though, in fact, this just highlighted that I need to get around to tuning the printer). The gears looked like the meshed well and would spin nicely with little to no backlash when I attached them to scrap wood. Overall, quite happy.
