So back in November [I posted on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpdWFCClF1m/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) about the new drone/quadcopter I just built, in an attempt to get back into drones and FPVracing. After that first post though, a keen eye will notice I never mentioned it again, until now. This is the rise and fall of Skippy.

## The build (The Rise)

To start with, I should mention the build itself, its practically all taken from [this rotorbuilds.com guide](https://rotorbuilds.com/build/10496) so all credit to them.

 - Diatone GT-M200 frame
 - Racerstar TattooF4S 4in1 flight controller
 - DYS Samguk 2207 2300kv motors
 - Dalprop 3-blade T5046C
 - Runcam Micro Sparrow 2 FPV camera
 - PandaRC Mini5804 vtx
 - Frsky xm+ rx
 - One of those newfangled "Pagoda" Antennas ([which btw, is a pretty neat evolution of the circularly polarized antennas that can be made on PCBs](https://www.maartenbaert.be/quadcopters/antennas/pagoda-antenna/))

Overall, it ended up costing around ~Â£250 with a battery. Here's some pretty pictures building it:

{% assign img_array = "1.jpg|2.jpg|3.jpg|4.jpg" | split: "|" %}

{% assign caption_array = "GT-M200 frame built up|Soldering in the reciever and checking the FPV camera|Fully built up sans battery|Connecting it up to the PC and checking config, note the tight packaging" | split: "|" %}

{% include img_slide.html assetsFolder=page.assets link=img_array caption=caption_array showindex=1 %}

The build was relatively simple, and although my other builds way back were on the slightly larger 250mm-class drones, this frame was actually still quite easy to work around. I was quite impressed with how small the device was, and how far flight controllers and electronic speed controllers had evolved (You could even put music on them now!).

## Flying it for the first time (The Fall)
All built up, it was looking sweet, like a tiny angry air beating machine. I was so excited to try it out I even hovered it inside my room (Note this is a terrible idea, those props **will** fuck your day up or your belongings). I double checked the failsafes, the lost quad beeping mode, the calibration and then charged up the batteries and waited.

When Saturday finally arrived I headed down to my local fields, loaded with equipment and spares, and a little too much confidence. Again I double checked the screws and retightened everything, checked the failsafes, checked the camera was working, and set off. Now, flying small drones in `acro` mode with goggles is actually quite hard; it didn't look like the [smooth videos on youtube, darting between trees and derelict construction sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MBW8zoZUR4). There was a lot of panic strafing and accidental bopping against the floor. Nonetheless sooner or later I was flying, albeit cautiously, between goal posts and doing simple flips. Overall good day, but the sun was coming down and it was time to pack up.

> "But then again, what harm could one more flight do?" - My dumb dumb self

I lost visual reference and speed across the field into the floor, hitting it hard and sending it flying back up, spinning another 20 meters into some bushes. Since I was wearing goggles I couldn't see where it landed and the spinning had seriously disorientated me. But its fine, what else is the find-lost-quad mode for? Of course that's when it hit me, that if I had lost video signal, it's probably because the **battery ejected**, and if it did that then the ESCs can't beep and its all fucked.

I searched and searched, methodically across all the bushes on the side of the field, to no avail. Then going to check the goggles themselves to see the recorded FPV videos I realised I hadn't recorded anything at all, instead taking stills when I thought it was turned on.

{% include img.html assetsFolder=page.assets link='5.jpg' caption="My last beacon of hope ended up being this shitty still" %}

At midnight I left, and came around looking again next Sunday, and then the Monday morning before work, and Tuesday, and ... etc. By the next Saturday I admitted defeat and declared Skippy (named post mortem due to its proclivity to skip on the floor) officially MIA. **Goddamnit**.

## Conclusion
Lessons learned (the expensive way):
 - Failsafes and beepers are great until your battery ejects. Need to make some sort of lock so even if it falls off the platform it doesn't disconnect.
 - Make sure the DVR function is working before flying in earnest.
 - Practice more on [simulators](http://www.liftoff-game.com/) before flying for real (this one should have been clear to me after all the simulation/HIL engineering I've done)

### Credit
- [Rotorbuilds](https://rotorbuilds.com/) for making a super nice build so that I dont have to whip out the calculator to size the components.
- [Hobbyking](https://hobbyking.com/) and [Banggood](https://eu.banggood.com/) for making this hobby cheap enough that I can brush this off with only part of my soul dying.
