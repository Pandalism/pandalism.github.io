After the other month's adventures in just buying the damn thing, this is the collection of adventures in getting it all working, and giving my network a much  needed overhaul.

## Naming and turning the microserver on

Most important part of getting server is finding the right name for it. I happen to follow the very simple rule of naming devices after famous AI or robots in movies and comics, so I just collect the names whenever I see them for this precise moment. Examples from my list:

 - jarvis - Iron Man's trusty AI from the first movies.
 - friday - Jarvis' replacement once he started getting a little to self-aware.
 - project-2501 - Spontanously sentinent AI which forms the main antagonist in the unmissable *Ghost in the Shell*.
 - tachikoma, uchikoma, logikoma - the goofy AI powered tankettes seen in *Ghost in the Shell's* TV show.
 - ava - Deceptive AI from *Ex Machina*
 - skynet - *Terminator's* apocalypse bringer
 - CASE, TARS - The two computers from *Interstellar*
 - HAL-9000 - Antagonist from *2001: A Space Odyssey*
 - agent-smith - *The Matrix* subroutine which ends up breaking free and becoming sentient, I think?
 - seraph, oracle, trainman, keymaker,




## The First issues

## A Classic



## Conclusions

 - Sometimes you just want something and you will justify it anyway you want, but really, you just have to admit there's no rational reason why you want it; and that is OK.
 - Optimise before looking to buy something better. I see this often in the automotive world where suppliers are more than happy to just add more processing power when really, they should be looking at optimising the code. (OEM pays so who cares, right?)
 - Ask online sellers to please wrap up a server with *more* than a **cereal box**.
