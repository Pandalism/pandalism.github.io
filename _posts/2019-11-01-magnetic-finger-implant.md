I admit my often unrestrained curiosity makes me delve into subjects outside of engineering, and medicine is a particular topic I always wish I knew more of, thus its no surprise I particularly like the cross over of engineering and medicine, foremost in the aspect of enhancing or supplementing our bodies te better ourselves. Colloquially called 'biohacking', last year I decided to do one of the simpler and older procedures known as 'biohacking' and got a magnet implanted in my ring finger. Sound a bit nuts? Maybe, but this has been my experience so far:


## Introduction
Biohacking conveys the image of seedy back ally chopshop combinations of man and machine, bringing superhuman abilities and powerful prosthetics to the user. In reality it is a lot more like a bunch of DIY'ers who like to [stick electronic things under their skin](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/29/pegleg-raspberry-pi-implanted-below-the-skin-not-coming-to-a-store-near-you/) or [take nootropics](https://neurohacker.com/biohacking-nootropics-for-better-brain-function); a sort of fusion, of hackers and the body modification tribes, usually better represented by the slightly more gristly term: Grinders. (mote there is also a growing trend of using the biohacking term in articles about ordinary healthy eating, sleeping and vitamins, a complete misuse if you ask me)

Nonetheless the reality is medicine and biomedical engineering has come so far, repairing limbs, letting the deaf hear, returning sight to those who lost it long ago, etc. One can only stop an admire the ability of mankind to overcome pathologies and diseases which have pestered our pursuit to a long quality life. However that's really where it ends. Where are the **enhancements**? Where is the **extra** limbs and **infrared capable** eyes promised in all that sci-fi and cyberpunk media? I understand why the medical associations and  around the world don't allow it (apart from those pesky state-sponsored doping programmes that get leaked once in a while), but it still generally surprises me we haven't seen more advancements. I guess the military would be keeping all their developments secret...

I'm clearly not the only one who thinks the same either, [transumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) as a concept has been around for long, and the origins of 'grinder' style biohacking comes from the mid 80's. Which leads me to this little experiment i partook in right here, whilst I waited for the ability for a [self balancing tail](https://futurism.com/the-byte/robot-tail-balance), I decided to get a magnetic implant.

## Risks

Obviously this is a particularly risky thing to do, cutting into our primary pathogen barrier isn't great. There's the risk of infection around the cut, as well as potentially snipping the nerves around the pad of the finger tip and ending up losing sensation. This is really inevitable, and I just hoped that the professional I hired was going to do a reasonable job.

The other risk is having the magnet lose its protective biosafe cover whilst still inside. Neodynium magnets are normally coated with nickle and copper, which isnt ideal in the best of cases, but even worse is if the magnet itself cracks. The corrosion is really quick and the neodynium will literally start turning to dust as your body provides the ideal oxygen-rich, electrically conductive environment.It starts discolouring the skin and inflaming the area, plus its apparently painful. The terribly scary bit is removing the bits as they start to crack and decompose, aparently to an olive paste texture!

## Implant

I have no tattoos, and only ever had my ears pierced, so I was unsure how i'd deal with the whole implantting things under my skin aspect. In the end its quite simple:
- Anaesthetise with analgesic cream
- Disinfect skin
- Disinfect magnet
- Cut slit into finger pad, off to the side to avoid nerves
- Insert magnet
- Tape up

That's right, not even stitches to hold it in place...

## Continuation and Final Notes

Experiments! I mean, its in there now, so not much else to do other than have some fun with it. I have yet to get around to it but I particularly would love to test passing music and other stimuli through
