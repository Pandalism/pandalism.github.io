Just another weekend dusting off the 3D printer! This time making an adapter bracket to fix a seat onto a rowing machine, and a tiny little wingnut thingy to help a friend who needed one for their easel.

## Rowing machine seat adapter
Some time ago I got a rowing machine off of freecycle.org, however as per usual freecycle shenanigans, the seat was missing. So it lived in my garage for the last couple of months whilst I figured out what to convert it to or how to reuse it.

Lo and behold I saw one of those sit-up trainers laying in the trash cycling home one day. I noticed that the headrest portion looked ideal for exactly that purpose! Long story short, made a two piece 3d printed adapter plate which adapts the hole pattern from one to the other, and now I have a functioning rowing machine!

## Wingnut
My friend lost a wingnut that held together her easel, so whilst the 3D printer was still hot I made a small wingnut adapter thing which a nut can drop in. It kinda works, but obviously due to the layering and the shape of it its a bit fragile than I'd like and the wing broke whilst tightening... still works and it was a test for overhangs more than anything.
