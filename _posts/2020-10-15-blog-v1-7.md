Welp! a whole year has passed since last major change but here we are, v1.7, with a newfangled projects page (including a gallery!), some touching up in CSS and a few bug fixes.

## Projects
This was something which has been on the website task list for a while, but I was sort of running away from it, apprehensive that I'd have to redo a lot of CSS code and what not.
In the end, it was actually quite easy even just using normal block display. I did realise however that I could have probably used CSS grid, as it turns out its much more widely accepted now than I rememebered (CSS is seems to evolve at a breakneck speed if you ask me). The gallery itself is nothing special so won't show the code, especially if I change it to `display: grid;` later.

{% include img.html assetsFolder=page.assets link='projects.png' caption="Square gallery!" %}

Nonetheless, quite happy with it, need to add more projects to it but that'll be over time.

## New workflow
Also decided to take the time to shake things up regarding how I was working, it seemed to take a little too long to write a post and test it, plus the repo was looking a bit messy
- Moved the development environment to a Xubuntu VM, as it feels much more snappy,
- Reinstalled Jekyll and github-pages and updated it all (`gem install github-pages`, which for some reason is missing in the tutorial)
- Setup snippets in atom for various html includes
- Cleaned out the code of unfinished posts and stagnant branches, will now focus on using them more liberally, and keep the `master` branch clear until a post is released. Not sure if it'll be with feature branches **and** post branches or a general post branch, with maybe a pre-release branch?? Not sure, I'll have to experiment with it. [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [Github-flow](https://githubflow.github.io/).

All of this is a bit silly for the blog, but I just would like to at least practice some of this, as work currently doesn't give me any such opportunities.

## Bug fixes
Some tiny bug fixes were involved too. Fixing Liquid curly braces breaking the pages and and the include img.html introducing `<p>` tags breaking the nice formatting.

## Future plans
 - Rebuild projects gallery to use CSS grid (turns out it is now much more widely accepted than I remember)
 - Figure out how to embed Binder notebooks seamlessly into the posts
 - Refactor the crap out of the CSS and experiment in trying to simplify down the whole page (massive undertaking)
 - Add more projects and post more!

## Afterthoughts
