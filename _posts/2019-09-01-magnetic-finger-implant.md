I admit my often unrestrained curiosity makes me delve into subjects outside of engineering, and medicine is a particular topic I always wish I knew more of, thus its no surprise I particularly like the cross over of engineering and medicine, foremost in the aspect of enhancing or supplementing our bodies te better ourselves. Colloquially called 'biohacking', last year I decided to do one of the simpler and older procedures known as 'biohacking' and got a magnet implanted in my ring finger. Sound a bit nuts? Maybe, but this has been my experience so far:


## Introduction
Biohacking conveys the image of seedy back ally chopshop combinations of man and machine, bringing superhuman abilities and powerful prosthetics to the user. In reality it is a lot more like a bunch of DIY'ers who like to stick electronic things under their skin or take nootropics; a sort of fusion, of hackers and the body modification tribes, usually better represented by the slightly more gristly term: Grinders. (mote there is also a growing trend of using the biohacking term in articles about ordinary healthy eating, sleeping and vitamins, a complete misuse if you ask me)

Nonetheless the reality is medicine and biomedical engineering has come so far, repairing limbs, letting the deaf hear, returning sight to those who lost it long ago, etc. One can only stop an admire the ability of mankind to overcome pathologies and diseases which have pestered our pursuit to a long quality life. However that's really where it ends. Where are the **enhancements**? Where is the **extra** limbs and infrared capable eyes promised in all that sci-fi and cyberpunk media? I understand why the medical associations and  around the world don't allow it (apart from those pesky state-sponsored doping programmes that get leaked once in a while), but it still generally surprises me we haven't seen more advancements. I guess the military wouldn't be publishing papers...

I'm clearly not the only one who thinks the same either, [transumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) as a concept has been around for long, and the origins of 'grinder' style biohacking comes from the mid 80's. Which leads me to this little experiment i partook in right here, whilst I waited for the ability for a [self balancing tail](https://futurism.com/the-byte/robot-tail-balance), I decided to get a magnetic implant.

Paragraph of text is just writing. Make sure to leave new lines between both. First paragraph will be used for excerpts when displaying excerpts in summary pages. Some formatting you can do in markdown: *italics* or _italics_, **bold** or __bold__, _**both**_, and ~~strikethroughs~~. Also can add links using [inline methods](#) and [reference methods][1], even spicing them up using titles/helptips [like so](# "example").

#### Really big tables:

dont make tables much bigger than above.

#### code:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

You can also put code inline as part of a paragraph. `its rather easy` using back-ticks.
