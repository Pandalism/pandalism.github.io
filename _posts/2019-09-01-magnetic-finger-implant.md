I admit my often unrestrained curiosity makes me delve into subjects outside of engineering, and medicine is a particular topic I always wish I knew more of, thus its no surprise I particularly like the cross over of engineering and medicine, foremost in the aspect of enhancing or supplementing our bodies te better ourselves. Colloquially called 'biohacking', last year I decided to do one of the simpler and older procedures known as 'biohacking' and got a magnet implanted in my ring finger. Sound a bit nuts? Maybe, but this has been my experience so far:

## Introduction

Medicine and biomedical engineering has come so far, one can only stop an admire the ability of mankind to overcome pathologies and diseases, whether its minor growth mistakes such as impacted wisdom teeth, or shortsightedness, to major and unbelievable procedures seen in organ transplants, open heart surgery. Its really remarkable how capable we have become to bring us back to baseline functional human. However that's really where it ends. Where are the **enhancements**? Where is the extra limbs and infrared capable eyes promised in all that sci-fi and cyberpunk media? I understand why the medical associations and  around the world don't allow it (apart from those pesky state-sponsored doping programmes that get leaked once in a while), but it still generally surprises me we haven't seen more advancements. I guess the military wouldn't be publishing papers...

Regardless I'm clearly not the only one who thinks there is much potential here since the concept of 'biohacking' has been around for a while. I personally don't quite like the term, invoking imagery of underground communities churning out enhancements of the likes seen in ghost in the shell or Deux Ex: Revolution, when really 80% of the community only talks about nootropics (and 15% talk about absolute nonsense like magnetic healing). The concept and some of the experiments people have done on a DIY basis is nonetheless quite interesting, and it caught my attention.

Paragraph of text is just writing. Make sure to leave new lines between both. First paragraph will be used for excerpts when displaying excerpts in summary pages. Some formatting you can do in markdown: *italics* or _italics_, **bold** or __bold__, _**both**_, and ~~strikethroughs~~. Also can add links using [inline methods](#) and [reference methods][1], even spicing them up using titles/helptips [like so](# "example").

#### Really big tables:

dont make tables much bigger than above.

#### code:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

You can also put code inline as part of a paragraph. `its rather easy` using back-ticks.
