Paragraph of text is just writing. Make sure to leave new lines between both. First paragraph will be used for excerpts when displaying excerpts in summary pages. Some formatting you can do in markdown: *italics* or _italics_, **bold** or __bold__, _**both**_, and ~~strikethroughs~~. Also can add links using [inline methods](#) and [reference methods][1], even spicing them up using titles/helptips [like so](# "example").

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example). Similarly images can be inline or referenced:

![alttext](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400)
*Caption*

[![example Image](https://via.placeholder.com/400x400)*this image is a link with a linked caption*](http://google.com/)

<figcaption>standard table size </figcaption>

#### Really big tables:

dont make tables much bigger than above.

#### code:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

You can also put code inline as part of a paragraph. `its rather easy` using back-ticks.
