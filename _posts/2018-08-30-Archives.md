I'm going to be quite busy with life in general for the next couple of weeks, so I don't envision many chances to make nice small little projects here or there and make a post of it.
If I do get to work on my hobbies it will be to bring this website up to a reasonable standard, including some showcase projects and a little bit more thought out layout. In the meantime I figured I should upload some of the older stuff which might have warranted a post back when I was doing them. It would be great to pad out the blog anyways and figure out how posts are going to be displayed, what kind of layouts to expect, and so on. These posts will be marked `[Archives]` just for clarity:smile:.
