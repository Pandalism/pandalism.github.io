As part of my [rolling upgrades to the website](), I had decided to implement a method to easily add image slideshows to any post or page as I type, using the usual ```{% raw %}{% include %}{% endraw %}``` Jekyll command. Im quite happy with the result, so here's how I did it! I admit I am no expert on web development or Jekyll or anything of the sort, but I couldn't find any tutorial when I was making it so here I present my guide. If you see any issues, or minor mistakes, please comment, I am always learning!
