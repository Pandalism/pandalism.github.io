Another round of updates to the website! This time a comment section courtesy of Disqus and image slideshows.

## Comments

## Slideshow

Continuing from the work done to facilitate inserting images and pictures into the posts via includes, [mentioned here]({{site.url}}/2019/08/02/blog-v1-5/#pictures-and-downloads), I decided to go further and make a new include file which creates picture slideshows. Now there was a couple of requirements which I wanted:
- Can insert multiple slideshows in one post
- The page change of one of the slideshows must not affect another
- Minimal amount of javascript
- Has to be insertable in the blog as a Jekyll include

This meant it was a bit more custom than following a random tutorial. Actually I will write up about it in a separate blog in case some lost soul happens to need it, you can find it [HERE - UPDATE LINK WHEN RELEASED]().



{% include img.html assetsFolder=page.assets link='site.png' caption="New icons, css, tag clouds, and pages!" %}

## Future plans

Main features left to do are project pages and possibly a multiimage layout of sorts as well as slideshow style picture frame? and as always, CSS tweaks and writing more about older projects!

Slow but steady!
