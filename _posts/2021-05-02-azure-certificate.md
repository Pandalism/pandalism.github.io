Been a while since any update! Theres various reasons behind that including new job, complete network rebuild, new hobbies, new website workflow, etc. Some of it will end up in a post in the near future but for now I thought I'd give a tiny update: I got my DP-100 Azure Data Scientist certificate! Pretty interesting to learn about the Azure environment and how to train and deploy a pipeline on the cloud, and how incredibly scalable it is... Only downside is if you aren't careful there can be some suprise charges in there (in my case I accidentally used premium storage when I didn't need it)

Nothing after the break, told you it was a small update.
